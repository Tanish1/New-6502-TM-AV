# New-6502-TM-AV

Much nicer 6502 emulator with the same features as Skilldrick's 6502 emulator. The UI is more convenient for the user and more modern than the previous emulator. This emulator is hosted so anyone can access this 24/7.

New Features:
	
1. Auto-Save Function -> Automatically saves the content in the code area into the browser's local storage.
	
2. Download Button -> Downloads the content in the code area as a .txt file.
	
3. A much better UI and scaling techniques so the website can work on most computers.
	
Bug Fixes:
	
1. Emulator implementation COMPLETE (works perfectly)
	
2. Hosted on GitHub Pages successfully
	
3. Scaling Fix for smaller resolution screens
	
4. Local Storage on FireFox fixed
